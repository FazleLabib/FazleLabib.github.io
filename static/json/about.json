    "article": "I'm a software engineer and researcher based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My research interests are along the line of AI security and vulnerability, adversarial attacks, privacy-preserving machine learning, and computer vision. I'm especially interested in building AI systems that are resilient and trustworthy. Alongside my technical work, I enjoy exploring design, often fiddling with graphic design projects. Outside of work, I'm drawn to compelling storytelling, whether it's in a film, a book, or role-playing games.",
